> Author of the non-periodical blog, proud Ravendor, mother of dragons - *well* â€“ ok, it's a marimo ball called Flo, but still!

**A long time ago** in a galaxy far, far away... I've decided to take an online quizz. It was called, *"What Programming Language Are You?"* Since I had already taken a test called *"Which "Friends" Character Are You?"* I told my self, "oh, why the heck no?". To cut the story short, I ended up with a test result that made me google "data science - learn for free".

Fast forward to the *present day:* I've been asking myself, where would I like to work? I knew I needed to somehow combine my passion for data with my desire to help people. It turned out that HR and Data are the perfect match for me. And, oh, I got Chandler.
