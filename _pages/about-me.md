> Author of the non-periodical blog, proud Ravendor, mother of dragons - *well* – ok, it's a marimo ball called Flo, but still!

**A long time ago** in a galaxy far, far away... I've decided to take an online quizz. It was called, *"What Programming Language Are You?"* Since I've alredy took the test *"Which "Friends" Character Are You?"* I told my self, "oh, why the heck no?". Moving bit forward I ended up googling "data science - learn for free".

Fast forward to the *present day.* I asked my self where would I like to work? I knew I needed to somehow combine my passion for the data with the need to help people. It turned out that HR and Data are the perfect match for me. And, oh, I got Chandler.
